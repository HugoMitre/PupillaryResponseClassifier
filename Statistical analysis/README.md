### This folder contains the statistical analysis of each of the calculated variables.
There are six folders for each of the calculated variables (APCPS, Entropy, MPDC, PD, PDS, and TTP). 
All folders contain three files: 
- **.RMD**: is a word processor that also offers the possibility of including pieces of code from R. This report that contains the analysis for each variable can be executed from RStudio. 
- **.pdf**: Illustrates the output of the .Rmd file in pdf format. 
- **.html**: Illustrates the output of the .Rmd file in html format. 

***To execute the .Rmd file correctly is necessary to have the file with the calculated variables.***
