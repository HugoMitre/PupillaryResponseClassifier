MasterVisual.py was developed in python 3.8.3. To execute this file is necessary to have the following libraries:

- Pandas> = 1.0.5
- Numpy> = 1.18.5
- Scipy> = 1.5.0 

When executed, the variables are calculated for each participant and each of the tests they performed. At the end, a CSV file is generated with all the calculated variables.
